### NOAA Storm Data Application

This application is created for the [Coursera Reproducible Research Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod). On earlier [course](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata) we have analysized storm database from U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA).

This application take the same [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) and make it interactive for the user to explore the dataset on their own without the need to learn R. For full description on my own analysis of this dataset, it is available on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/gosaldar/82046).

The source code for the application is available on Github.
